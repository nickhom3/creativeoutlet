        <p>I chose to attend UCLA for its finance-driven Economics degree, its fair weather, and urban location. While my studies thus far have focused on understanding micro and macro economic patterns, I have supplemented my major with extra classes in statistics and programming. I hope that my Economics degree will provide my with a strong quantitative foundation, while the Entrepreneurship and Digital Humanities minors will fully flush out my knowledge of business operations and of emerging technologies. UCLA has offered me the &quot;big school experience&quot; that I had been looking for, allowing me to explore activities, experiences, and types of people absent from my private education.</p>

        <p>The unexpected opportunities that this school offered me, and those that I created myself, have shaped my intellectual and career-oriented interests to this day. Through my editorship of the school&#39;s student publication, it ingrained in me a sense of innovation and a chance at large-scale leadership. From the small-but-spirited community, I was able to find others who shared entrepreneurial visions and build my own company, and through the institution, I was able to take a risk in enrolling in the inaugural International Baccalaureate class, which eventually established my enthousiasm for economics.</p>

Eventually, with enough knowledge of the company&#39;s operations, we were able to reach out to startups around the Bay Area for sponsorship opportunities.</p>

Initially, the publication was a quarterly magazine that was mostly unread by the school community. Beginning my second year, I recreated the publication in its modern broadsheet and online forms. Because we lacked personnel to produce weekly issues, we tried to only write on events most impactful to our school and city communities. This publication became my baby, and I worked tirelessly to massively improve its readership and recognition as a valuable resource to the school. In my senior year, we submitted our body of work to the national association presiding over the country&#39;s scholastic publications and was awarded <b>2nd Place Best in Show</b> out of 212 contestants. I still consider this my greatest achievement, for it showed me what I was truly capable of given my full time and effort.</p>
